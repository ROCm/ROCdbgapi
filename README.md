Introduction
------------

The AMD Debugger API is a library that provides all the support necessary for a
debugger and other tools to perform low level control of the execution and
inspection of execution state of AMD's commercially available GPU architectures.

For more information about the AMD ROCm ecosystem, see:

- https://rocm.docs.amd.com/

Build the AMD Debugger API Library
----------------------------------

The ROCdbgapi library can be built on Ubuntu, RHEL, SLES, and Windows. See [supported Linux distributions](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#supported-operating-systems) and [supported Windows distributions](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-windows/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html).

Building the ROCdbgapi library has the following prerequisites:

1. A C++17 compiler such as GCC 7 or later, Clang 5 or later, or MSVC 19.15 or later.

2. AMD Code Object Manager Library (ROCcomgr). On Linux, this can be installed
   as part of the AMD ROCm release by the ``comgr`` package.  On Windows, this
   is installed as part of the HIP SDK release.

3. ROCm CMake modules, which can be installed using the ``rocm-cmake`` package
   available as part of the AMD ROCm release.

4. For Ubuntu, the following adds the needed packages:

   ````shell
   apt install gcc g++ make cmake doxygen graphviz texlive-full
   ````

   NOTE: The ``doxygen`` 1.8.13 that is installed by Ubuntu 18.04 has a bug
   that prevents the PDF from being created.  ``doxygen`` 1.8.11 can be built
   from source to avoid the issue.

5. For RHEL, the following adds the needed packages:

   ````shell
   sudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ make cmake doxygen graphviz texlive \
    texlive-xtab texlive-multirow texlive-sectsty texlive-tocloft \
    texlive-tabu texlive-adjustbox
   ````

   NOTE: The ``doxygen`` 1.8.14 that is installed by CentOS 8.1 and RHEL 8.1,
   has a bug that prevents the PDF from being created. ``doxygen`` 1.8.11 can be
   built from source to avoid the issue.

6. For SLES, the following adds the needed packages:

   ````shell
   sudo zypper in gcc gcc-c++ make cmake doxygen graphviz texlive-scheme-medium \
     texlive-hanging texlive-stackengine texlive-tocloft texlive-etoc \
     texlive-tabu
   ````

7. For Windows using MSYS2, the following adds the needed packages:

   ````shell
   pacman -S make mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc \
     texinfo texinfo-tex \
     mingw-w64-x86_64-texlive-plain-generic \
     mingw-w64-x86_64-texlive-latex-recommended \
     mingw-w64-x86_64-texlive-latex-extra \
     doxygen mingw-w64-x86_64-graphviz
   ````

Here is an example command line to build the ROCdbgapi library:

````shell
cd rocdbgapi
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ..
make
````

You may substitute a path of your own choosing for ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``.

By default, ROCdbapi is built as a shared library. To build it
as a static library instead, set the ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` cmake
variable to ``OFF``.

````shell
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install \
  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF ..
````

The built ROCdbgapi library will be placed in:

- ``build/include/amd-dbgapi.h``
- ``build/librocm-dbgapi.(a|so*|dll|dll.a|lib)``

An example command-line to generate the HTML and PDF library documentation is:

````shell
make doc
````

The generated ROCdbgapi library documentation is put in:

- ``doc/html/index.html``
- ``doc/latex/refman.pdf``

To install the ROCdbgapi library and documentation:

````shell
make install
````

The installed ROCdbgapi library and documentation will be placed in:

- ``../install/include/amd-dbgapi.h``
- ``../install/lib/librocm-dbgapi.*``
- ``../install/share/amd-dbgapi/LICENSE.txt``
- ``../install/share/amd-dbgapi/README.md``
- ``../install/share/html/amd-dbgapi/index.html``
- ``../install/share/doc/amd-dbgapi/amd-dbgapi.pdf``

Running the AMD Debugger API Library
------------------------------------

To use the ROCdbgapi library, the ROCcomgr library must be installed.  On Linux,
this can be installed as part of the AMD ROCm release by the ``comgr`` package:

- ``libamd_comgr.so``

On Windows, ROCcomgr is installed as part of the HIP SDK release:

- ``C:\Windows\System32\amd_comgr_*.dll``

To enable AMD GPU debugging, the ROCdbgapi library requires that an AMD GPU
runtime library is loaded in the inferior:

- On Linux, the required runtime library is AMD's implementation of the HSA
  runtime, maintained by the ROCr (ROCm Runtime) project.  This can be installed
  using the ``hsa-rocr-dev`` package available as part of the AMD ROCm release:

  ``libhsa-runtime64.so``

- On Windows, the required runtime library is AMD's HIP runtime library,
  maintained by the CLR project.  This is installed as part of the HIP SDK
  release:

  ``C:\Windows\System32\amdhip64_*.dll``

The AMD Debugger API library has an optional runtime dependency to the
`amdgpu.ids` database file, located in `/opt/amdgpu/share/libdrm/amdgpu.ids`
or `/usr/share/libdrm/amdgpu.ids`.

The `/opt/amdgpu/share/libdrm/amdgpu.ids` database is provided by the
`libdrm-amdgpu-common` ROCm package on all Linux distributions.

The `/usr/share/libdrm/amdgpu.ids` is provided by the following packages:
- SLES: `libdrm-amdgpu`
- RHEL: `libdrm`
- Debian and Ubuntu: `libdrm-common`

Known Limitations and Restrictions
----------------------------------

You can refer to the following sections in the *AMD Debugger API Specification*
documentation for:

- *Supported AMD GPU Architectures* provides the list of supported AMD GPU
  architectures.

  limitations and restrictions.
