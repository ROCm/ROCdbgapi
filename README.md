AMD Debugger API (ROCdbgapi)
============================

Introduction
------------

The AMD Debugger API is a library that provides all the support necessary for a
debugger and other tools to perform low level control of the execution and
inspection of execution state of AMD's commercially available GPU architectures.

For more information about the AMD ROCm ecosystem, see:

Build the AMD Debugger API Library
----------------------------------

The ROCdbgapi library can be built on Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, Centos 8.1,
RHEL 8.1, and SLES 15 Service Pack 1.

Building the ROCdbgapi library has the following prerequisites:

1. A C++17 compiler such as GCC 7 or Clang 5.

2. AMD Code Object Manager Library (ROCcomgr) which can be installed as part of
   the AMD ROCm release by the ``comgr`` package.

3. ROCm CMake modules which can be installed as part of the AMD ROCm release by
   the ``rocm-cmake`` package.

4. For Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 the following adds the needed packages:

   ````shell
   apt install gcc g++ make cmake doxygen graphviz texlive-full pci.ids
   ````

   NOTE: The ``doxygen`` 1.8.13 that is installed by Ubuntu 18.04 has a bug
   that prevents the PDF from being created.  ``doxygen`` 1.8.11 can be built
   from source to avoid the issue.

5. For CentOS 8.1 and RHEL 8.1 the following adds the needed packages:

   ````shell
   yum install -y gcc gcc-g++ make cmake doxygen graphviz texlive \
     texlive-xtab texlive-multirow texlive-sectsty texlive-tocloft \
     texlive-tabu texlive-adjustbox hwdata
   ````

   NOTE: The ``doxygen`` 1.8.14 that is installed by CentOS 8.1 and RHEL 8.1,
   has a bug that prevents the PDF from being created. ``doxygen`` 1.8.11 can be
   built from source to avoid the issue.

6. For SLES 15 Service Pack 15 the following adds the needed packages:

   ````shell
   zypper in gcc gcc-g++ make cmake doxygen graphviz texlive-scheme-medium \
     texlive-hanging texlive-stackengine texlive-tocloft texlive-etoc \
     texlive-tabu hwdata
   ````

An example command-line to build the ROCdbgapi library on Linux is:

````shell
cd rocdbgapi
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ..
make
````

You may substitute a path of your own choosing for ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``.

The built ROCdbgapi library will be placed in:

- ``build/include/amd-dbgapi.h``
- ``build/librocm-dbgapi.so*``

An example command-line to generate the HTML and PDF library documentation is:

````shell
make doc
````

The generated ROCdbgapi library documentation is put in:

- ``doc/html/index.html``
- ``doc/latex/refman.pdf``

To install the ROCdbgapi library and documentation:

````shell
make install
````

The installed ROCdbgapi library and documentation will be placed in:

- ``../install/include/amd-dbgapi.h``
- ``../install/lib/librocm-dbgapi.so*``
- ``../install/share/amd-dbgapi/LICENSE.txt``
- ``../install/share/amd-dbgapi/README.md``
- ``../install/share/html/amd-dbgapi/index.html``
- ``../install/share/doc/amd-dbgapi/amd-dbgapi.pdf``

To use the ROCdbgapi library, the ROCcomgr library must be installed.  This can
be installed as part of the AMD ROCm release by the ``comgr`` package:

- ``libamd_comgr.so.1``

The ROCdbgapi library requires that the ROCr library is loaded in the inferior
to enable AMD GPU debugging.  This can be installed as part of the AMD ROCm
release by the ``hsa-rocr-dev`` package:

- ``libhsa-runtime64.so.1 ``

Known Limitations and Restrictions
----------------------------------

You can refer to the following sections in the *AMD Debugger API Specification*
documentation for:

- *Supported AMD GPU Architectures* provides the list of supported AMD GPU
  architectures.
- *Known Limitations and Restrictions* provides information about known
  limitations and restrictions.

The ROCdbgapi library is compatible with the following interface versions:

- *AMD GPU Driver Version*
  - See ``KFD_IOCTL_MAJOR_VERSION`` and ``KFD_IOCTL_MINOR_VERSION`` in
    ``src/linux/kfd_ioctl.h`` which conform to [semver](http://semver.org/).
- *AMD GPU Driver Debug ioctl Version*
  - See ``KFD_IOCTL_DBG_MAJOR_VERSION`` and ``KFD_IOCTL_DBG_MINOR_VERSION`` in
    ``src/linux/kfd_ioctl.h`` which conform to [semver](http://semver.org/).
- *ROCm Runtime r_debug ABI Version*
  - See ``ROCR_RDEBUG_VERSION`` in ``src/rocr_rdebug.h``.
- *Architectures and Firmware Versions*
  - See ``s_gfxip_lookup_table`` in ``src/os_driver.cpp``.
